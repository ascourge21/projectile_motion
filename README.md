# projectile_motion
Here, we'll make projectile simulations (in 2d) where velocity and angle
can be changed.
Ultimately, we'll try to integrate this with a neural network based solver
that'll try to estimate the velocity and angle that scores the ball in the basket
starting from some random initial position.
